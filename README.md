# softAP

This is the beginning of my Particle Photon powered product.

This project allows the Photon to host a simple webpage to enter WiFi credentials on the Photon while it is in listening mode.

Also, the Photon will enter listening mode whenever the WiFi connection times out or when no known networks are available.

This project can be built using [po-util](https://nrobinson2000.github.io/po-util/).
